Hello World, Kandyce here!

I am new to development, but it won't be long before I am rocking and rolling.

I intend to do front end web design in conjunction with my User Experience training, but eventually I'll circle back around with JavaScript.

_I am **familiar** with Markdown so I'm playing with it now._
